# Project Title

Create a SIGN Up activity with Username and Password. Validation of password should happen based on the following rules:
• Password should contain uppercase and lower case letters.
• Password should contain letters and numbers.
• Password should contain special characters.
• Minimum length of the password (the default value is8).
On successful SIGN UP proceed to the next Login activity. Here the user should SIGN IN using the Username and Password created during signup activity. If the Username and Password are matched then navigate to the next activity which displays a message saying “Successful Login” or else display a toast message saying “Login Failed”. The user is given only two attempts and after that display a toast message saying “Failed Login Attempts” and disable the SIGN IN button. Use Bundle to transfer information from one activity to another.
